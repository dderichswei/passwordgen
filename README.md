# DirkÂ´s Passwordgenerator

As I am using hasicorp vault and KeePass i required something to create an password with my TouchPortal.  
This little tool creates passwords and put them into you KeePass File and even in you vault KeyValue store.  

vault must be manually configured, if not required you can turn off the vault support.


## How to start 
```
python3 passwordgen.py
```
